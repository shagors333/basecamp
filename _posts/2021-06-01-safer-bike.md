Crowdsourcing safer bicycle lane design

We talked a while 

We're also inviting cities to work with us under our [Safer.Bike](https://www.safer.bike/) initiative. Using what we learn from locations around the world we want to provide local governments with the best data to make the best investment decisions for new bicycle infrastructure in their districts to eliminate all avoidable cyclist deaths caused by road vehicles.


If you have a 360 camera, great. Otherwise a smartphone mounted to your handlebars (securely!) will do. Record a series of timelapse photos or a single video.


Use the Map the Paths Desktop Uploader to get your imagery online. All data is synced with Mapillary and OpenStreetMap too which means you'll be helping to improve maps of your location.


Whilst you browse your images, and the images captured by others on Map the Paths, our computer vision software will also look for objects inside the images.

We're working directly with city planners to share our findings. This is a free service and any city is welcome to register. We're officially working with the following cities; Amsterdam (NL), London (UK), Bristol (UK), and Cambridge (UK). Even if your city is not listed (yet) any imagery you capture will still be useful.
