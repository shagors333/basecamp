We're also inviting cities to work with us under our [Safer.Bike](https://www.safer.bike/) initiative. Using what we learn from locations around the world we want to provide local governments with the best data to make the best investment decisions for new bicycle infrastructure in their districts to eliminate all avoidable cyclist deaths caused by road vehicles.
