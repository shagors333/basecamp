**OSM and Wikipedia overlays, weather reports, navigation by altitude, and more!**

Firstly I’d like to say a big thank you to everyone who has uploaded their off-road 360 tours to https://www.mapthepaths.com/.

We’ve passed 100,000 panoramas. Onto 1 million!

I’d like to use this post to share some of the recent features we’ve shipped.
