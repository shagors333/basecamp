**OSM and Wikipedia overlays, weather reports, navigation by altitude, and more!**

Firstly I’d like to say a big thank you to everyone who has uploaded their off-road 360 tours to [Map the Paths](https://www.mapthepaths.com/).

We’ve passed 100,000 panoramas at the start of the year. Onto 1 million!

I’d like to use this post to share some of the recent features we’ve shipped.

## Overlay of OSM and Wikipedia Points of Interest

See what's nearby to an image on Map the Paths using OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia data overlays.

## Weather reports

View the weather at the time of capture for any Map the Paths image.


## Commenting on photos

## Navigate by altitude

Find the best views using the altitude navigation on Map the Paths.

[p.s. You can so sort photos by viewpoint to find the very best views](https://www.mapthepaths.com/sequence/photo).

## Add photos and videos to Guidebooks

Create a Map the Paths Guidebook of street-level photos to show people around a location. View others people have created to help plan your next adventure.

[Create a Guidebook here](https://www.mapthepaths.com/guidebook/list/).

## Augmented reality sequences

Track an entire Map the Paths Sequence as an image overlay showing the next and previous photos.

## Do you have an idea for a new feature?
