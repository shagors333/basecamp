**On your bikes, get set, GO!**

In September I moved to Amsterdam. Of course one of the first thing I did was buy a bicycle (and a good lock).

With my helmet mounted GoPro Max I to the streets to explore the city.

After a week spent riding a little over 75km and speaking to other cyclists (everyone!) it became clear there were many improvements that could be made.

Of course, it's all relative. Amsterdam boasts the best cycling infrastructure for a major city that I've seen, but there's always room for improvement.

And many of the people I spoke to were keen to play there part. So we decided to create a challenge around pedal power, 360 cameras and computer vision that anyone can take part in.

Every Sequence uploaded to Map the Paths in the Amsterdam area by bicycle (inc. eBikes) will earn you points on the Challenge Leaderboard.

We're going to use every image uploaded to abstract data from them using computer vision to identify areas improvements.

Poor line markings, broken pavements, confusing signing are all things we'll be trying to detect, alerting the city infrastructure teams when we find them.

But it doesn't just stop at Amsterdam.

We want YOU to help us capture images of your city, town, or even village by bicycle. Create a Cycling Challenge on Map the Paths and get your community involved in capturing photos.

We're also inviting cities to work with us under our [Safer.Bike](https://www.safer.bike/) initiative. Using what we learn from locations around the world we want to help to design bicycle lanes that will eliminate all cyclist deaths caused by road vehicles.

What are you waiting for? ON YOUR BIKE!

p.s. Challenges can be set for other 20 other activities, if cycling isn't your thing.
