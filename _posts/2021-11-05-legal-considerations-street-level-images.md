**A general guide to the legalities of capturing outdoor virtual tours.**

Many people, rightly, have questions about the legality capturing Street View photos and videos outdoors.

Whilst I have no legal qualifications, here's what I've discovered over the last few years.

In the UK, there is no law preventing people from taking photographs in a public place. This includes taking photos of other people’s children.

Generally speaking, this is the same in most Western based countries too.

If you are taking photographs from private land, you need to have the land owner’s permission. Keep in mind, that what you believe to be public land might be private. A good example of private land being free to access National Trust woodland.

Similarly, the photo above might seem a public place. Outside Paddington station, on the towpath of the Regents Canal. In fact, this land is private and owned by the European Land and Property.

Public land might also overlook private land. Taking a photo of a person where they can expect privacy, such as inside their home or garden, is likely to cause a breach of privacy laws.

Interestingly, in the USA I discovered whilst it's typically OK to take a photo of a person in a public place, [remote sensing of the earth from outer space (perhaps to photograph Astronauts) requires a license](https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/CRSRA/licenseHome.html)!

Assuming you are taking photos of a public place, and the images are not deemed to be indecent, no one has the right to:

* ask a photographer to stop
* ask for a copy of the photos 
* force a photographer to delete the photographs

Of course, laws get much more complex and differ by geography.

For UK based photographers, [this article is particularly useful in covering some of the finer details](http://www.photographers-resource.co.uk/photography/Legal/Access_Rights.htm).

It's also important to stress that this post covers the legalities of capturing imagery outdoors, but it does not address the moral issues.

For example, I avoid capturing in areas children might be playing. Whilst this is legal, morally, I know parents will be rightly concerned with someone capturing footage of their children.

[People might not realise the imagery will be blurred](/blog/2020/how-to-blur-street-level-images). Others might not agree with [the privacy policies of the aforementioned services](/blog/2020/google-street-view-microsoft-bing-maps-facebook-mapillary-apple-look-around).

You will have to make your own moral judgements about where you shoot, and where you upload the content.
