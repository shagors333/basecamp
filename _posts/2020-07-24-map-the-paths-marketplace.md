**Let's get exploring**

Land, above sea level, [covers roughly 29 percent, of the earth's surface](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/how-much-water-there-earth?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects).

The surface area of the earth is 510.1 million km², with land covering 148.9 million km² of that.

Estimates of how much we've explored, both above and below sea level, very wildly. In part this is because how "explored” is defined differs depending on who you ask.

How many have you explored?

Thanks to user submissions, OpenStreetMap often lists footpaths, bikepaths, waterways, and other places to explore on your doorstep you might never have discovered.

Whilst these paths are mapped, very few have 360, street level imagery.

## Let's get mapping

Today I'm really excited to officially announce the Map the Paths Marketplace.

We built the Marketplace for two personas:

**Contributors**

To help photographers find work related to virtual tour and survey photography.

Photographers, [create a business profile listing your skills and working area so that people looking for imagery capture can get in contact with you](https://www.mapthepaths.com/marketplace/hire/create).

Alternatively, [browse and apply the growing number of projects being posted on the Marketplace](https://www.mapthepaths.com/marketplace/jobs/list).

**Organisations**

To help organisations connect to the many talented photographers we have in our network.

If you're thinking about virtual tour or survey photography, [create a job to showcase it to our database of skilled photographers](https://www.mapthepaths.com/marketplace/jobs/create).

Alternatively, [browse photographers in our database to find those near you and enquire about their services](https://www.mapthepaths.com/marketplace/hire/list).

## What's next?

Our overall aim of map the paths is to encourage and reward the collection of new street level 360 imagery.

We're currently working on a processing and upload tool for 360 outdoor tour imagery. Here's a sneak peak at two early mockups...
