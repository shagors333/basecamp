**2021 off-road edition**

A lot of guidance exists around creating virtual tours of businesses.

Ben Claremontâ€™s, [Which Is The Best Virtual Tour Software? (November 2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKkQQ0aHRSc), video is a good example of the types of comparisons that exist.

Many of the software products mentioned in that video do include the ability to upload the imagery to Google Street View, but in many cases the workflows and comparisons are based on shooting in a small area both indoors and outdoors.

I'm yet to find a comprehensive comparison of tools for outdoor, off-road Street View uploads.

[Last week I took a look at the Google Street View app in detail](/blog/2021/using-google-street-view-app). This week I'll take a look at other alternatives available of most use to off-road street-level 360 photographers.

**Version reviewed**

**Pros**

* Supports the phones camera: don't have a 360 camera? The Street View app allows you to take and upload flat or panoramic images to Street View.

You can also use it to 
* Support multiple 360 cameras: many camera manufactures build their cameras to [meet the Street View ready spec](https://developers.google.com/streetview/ready) and to support the Street View app. If you have a compatible camera all you need to so is download the app, connect your camera to the phone, and use the app to upload the images you capture.

**Cons**
