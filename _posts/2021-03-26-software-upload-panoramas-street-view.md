**2021 off-road edition.**

A lot of guidance exists around creating virtual tours of businesses.

Ben Claremontâ€™s, [Which Is The Best Virtual Tour Software? (November 2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKkQQ0aHRSc), video is a good example of the types of comparisons that exist.

Many of the software products mentioned in that video do include the ability to upload the imagery to Google Street View, but in many cases the workflows and comparisons are based on shooting in a small area both indoors and outdoors.

I'm yet to find a comprehensive comparison of tools for outdoor, off-road Street View uploads.

[Last week I took a look at the Google Street View app in detail](/blog/2021/using-google-street-view-app). This week I'll take a look at other alternatives available of most use to off-road street-level 360 photographers.

## Google Street View App

**Cost**

* Free

**Type**

* Mobile App:
	- ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/google-street-view/id904418768)
	- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.street&hl=en_GB&gl=US))

**Version reviewed**

Android 2.0.0.350158636 (publish date: 5th Jan 2021)

**Overview**

Overall this is a solid choice if you're taking a few photos with your phone, or want to connect it [to a supported 360 camera](https://developers.google.com/streetview/ready) for short adventures.

Doing everything on a phone limits your ability to process photos or videos before upload, which we don't like.

Phone battery life also becomes an issue when shooting long tours and it's very likely you'll need an external power pack for your phone to ensure it remains charged.

## GoThru StreetBuilder

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2021-03-26/google-street-view-app.png" alt="GoThru StreetBuilder" title="GoThru StreetBuilder" />

**Cost**

* Free for processing photos but pricing starts at $10 per 2 tours uploaded to Street View

**Type**

* Desktop app
	- [Mac](https://streetbuilder.co/)
	- [PC](https://streetbuilder.co/)

**Version reviewed**

1.0.34.

**Overview**

GoThru was one of the first pieces of software in the market allowing people to create indoor virtual tours and upload to Street View seamlessly.

StreetBuilder is great at helping extract the correct panoramas from videos or sequences of photos prior to upload.

To upload to Street View, you first need to upload to the GoThru platform and then publish Street View. This requires a paid GoThru plans, which if uploading many tours can become very expensive. $23.95 buys 10 tour uploads to Street View, costing $2 for each additional tour.

## Panoskin Trailblazer

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2021-03-26/panoskin-trailblazer.jpg" alt="Panoskin Trailblazer" title="Panoskin Trailblazer" />

**Cost**

* Free

**Type**

* Desktop app
	- [Mac](https://www.panoskin.com/trailblazer)
	- [PC](https://www.panoskin.com/trailblazer)

**Version reviewed**

1.2.0

**Overview**

Trailblazer was the app that got me into capturing adventure footage for Street View, so Panoskin have a special place in my heart.

The app only works with GoPro Fusion video and photo files. The newer MAX cameras are compatible with Trailblazer but only in photo / timelapse photo mode. 360 videos captured by the MAX do not seem to be compatible from my testing.

What I really liked about Trailblazer is the ability to add additional data to uploaded content, like name and what method of transport you used to capture with. The fact they don't charge to upload to Street View also earns it a plus point too!

## Map the Paths Uploader

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2021-03-26/mtpu-screenshot.jpg" alt="Map the Paths Uploader" title="Map the Paths Uploader" />

**Cost**

* Free

**Type**

* Desktop app
	- [Mac](https://www.mapthepaths.com/uploader)
	- [PC](https://www.mapthepaths.com/uploader)
	- [Linux](https://www.mapthepaths.com/uploader)

**Version reviewed**

0.0.3

**Overview**

OK, I'm biased on this one, however, the Map the Paths Uploader was built to solve the gaps in the above products when it comes to uploading outdoor virtual tours; a wide variety of different cameras, a large volume/size of content, a high degree of processing required, and all with very little money available.

It allows you to:

* Adds metadata to sequence for easy management and discovery
* Converts 360 video to 360 photo frames to store locally for photo editing
* Geotags images using GPS track files (if photos not geotagged)
* Provides a high degree of flexibility when editing photos
* Offers the ability to add a nadir
* Uploads to multiple web platforms
	- [Map the Paths](https://www.mapthepaths.com/)
	- [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com/)
	- [Google Street View](https://www.google.co.uk/maps)
	- [Strava](https://www.strava.com/)

It's also open-source, if you want to modify the code to do something more.
