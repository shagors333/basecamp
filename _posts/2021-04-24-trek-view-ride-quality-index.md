**Simple calculations**

[In the previous post I considered some apps that can be used to record raw data from your phones IMU](/blog/2021/measuring-condition-cycle-paths-phone-update).

[The Parks & Trails Council of Minnesota operate a Research Bike that documents the state of their bike trails](https://www.parksandtrails.org/mn-state-trails/). In addition to their intractive maps, [you can view their previous State of the Trails reports here](https://www.parksandtrails.org/advocacy/research/ptc/state-of-the-trails-report/).

The Trail Roughness Index (TRI) measures the variation in g-forces felt by a bicyclist riding on a trail. The g-force is measured by an accelerometer in a bicycle-mounted iPhone and is
g-force on vertical (Z) axis:
When a bicycle rides along a smooth trail, the accelerometer shows a relatively ï¿½lat line.
As trails age, bumps and cracks start to form in the pavement. The accelerometer records these imperfections when the bicycle rides over them.
When a trail is nearing the end of its useful life, bumps and cracks are prevalent. Accelerometer readings on such trails show a rocky, jagged line.
