**1 month. 10,000 km. 2 motorbikes. Few roads.**

The idea of an off-road adventure, exploring western parts of Russia, Mongolia and Siberia had long been brewing in Jyri Koskiâ€™s head. 

Broken Road to Siberia is an adventure motorcycle film about two friends, Jyri and Tuukka, who ride to the infamous Vitim bridge in remote Siberia.

The 10,000 km long journey through Russian wilderness, Altai mountains, Mongolian deserts and Siberian taiga take their toll as the journey progresses.

In this episode of ExPODition, David talks with Jyri Koski and Tuukka Josefsson about their motorcycle journey across Russia.

The conversation was recorded remotely on December 21st, 2020.
