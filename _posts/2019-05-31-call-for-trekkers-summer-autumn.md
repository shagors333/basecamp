**The start of summer is almost upon us.**

Here in the UK, the weather has already offered glimpses of summer...

...a good indication it will rain non-stop during the upcoming summer months.

As a Brit, now that I've made the obligatory reference to the weather, now I have a favour to ask...

## Become a Trekker

I'm looking for Trekkers to help capture new 360-degree tours over the summer and autumn.

**The focus is on 360 maps for water sports.**

Sailing boats, kayaks, canoes, stand-up paddle boards...

I can supply the waterproof 360-degree camera kit. You just need to supply the effort and mode of transport.

If you have a great place on the water you want to capture a 360 map of for others to enjoy, please [apply to the Trek View camera loan program today](/loan) -- I have Trek Packs ready for Trekkers.

Not a water person? That's OK too. I still encourage you to [submit an application to loan one of our Trek Packs](/loan).
