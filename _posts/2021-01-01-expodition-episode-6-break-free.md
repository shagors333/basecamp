**Hamburg to South Africa in a Land Rover. In 6 months?**

When Lena and Ulli start the engine of their old Land Rover, Lady Ter√©s, they have a plan: to drive from Hamburg to South Africa in six months. What they don't know yet is that they won't ever get there.

Two totally different characters, jammed together in two square meters of space for almost two years, they experience what it really means to travel: leaving your comfort zone for good. 

In this episode of ExPODition, David talks with  Ulrich Stirnat and Lena Wendt about the trials and tribulations of an overland crossing of the African continent. 

The conversation was recorded remotely on November 20th, 2020.
