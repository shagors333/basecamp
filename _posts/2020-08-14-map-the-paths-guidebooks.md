**Let's go exploring.**

I love to explore new places online. In fact, I am often guilty of spending more time looking than exploring on occasion.

Old guidebooks, even in a sea of online information, still provide details you'd be hard pressed to find online.

Curated by people who know the ins-and-outs of a location; those who know the best places to eat, thos who know where to go to avoid the crowds, and where that secret bar that serves cheap cocktails can be found.

The concept of online tours has boomed as the world locked down as COVID-19 took hold. [We even ran a few of our own](/blog/2020/virtual-tours-guided-by-local-experts).

I was really inspired by city tour guides who turned to Airbnb, Google Street View and Zoom to offer virtual tours in place of cancelled vacations.

So-much-so that I started thinking about ways to make this type of tour available to everyone, at scale.

## Introducing Guidebooks

Last month we launched the Map the Paths Marketplace. [Don't forget to post your mapping photograpy services -- we have new jobs posted daily](/blog/2020/map-the-paths-marketplace).

Keeping the ball rolling, today we're releasing a brand new feature, [Guidebooks](https://www.mapthepaths.com/guidebook).

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2020-08-14/mapthepaths-guidebooks-sm.jpg" alt="Guidebook scenes" title="Guidebook scenes" />

Guidebooks allow you to curate any images uploaded to Mapillary as scenes in a virtual Guidebooks.

Each scene can be annotated with points of interest. For example, you might want to point out a great view, historical information, or that great bar.

You can start creating your own Guidebooks on Map the Paths now.

Here are some I've created that you might like:
