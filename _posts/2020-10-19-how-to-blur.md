**We're a big believer in privacy.**

All faces and sensitive information (e.g. number plates) captured in our photos are blurred before being publicised.

If people make specific request for an image to be taken down because it contains their personal identifiable information (even a photo of thier house), we will delete it completely from our database.

## Google Street View

Google takes a number of steps to protect the privacy of individuals when Street View imagery is published to Google Maps.

[As their website states](https://www.google.com/streetview/policy/):

> We have developed cutting-edge face and license plate blurring technology that is designed to blur identifiable faces and license plates within Google-contributed imagery in Street View.

If you see that your face or license plate requires additional blurring, or if you would like us to blur your entire house, car, or body, you can also submit a request to Google for it to be blurred, like this one outside a Google office in San Francisco:

Here's how to submit a blur request to Google:

1. Go to Google Maps and enter the address where the person or object you want to blur is located

2. Enter into Street View mode by dragging the small yellow human-shaped icon, found in the bottom-right corner of the screen, onto the map in front of your house

3. With the person or object in view, click "Report a problem" in the bottom-right corner of the screen

4. Center the red box on the person or object, and select the correct option in the "Request blurring" field

5. Write in the provided field why you want the image blurred (for example, you may be concerned about safety issues)

6. Enter in your email address, and click "Submit"

Importantly, be sure it's what you want. Google warns you that once it has blurred your house on Street View "it is permanent."

It's not clear exactly how long Google takes to process the requests.

## Mapillary

[Facebook's Mapillary also employ state of the art blurring algorithms, in fact, according to some analysis it's much better than Google Street View](https://blog.mapillary.com/update/2019/09/12/protecting-privacy-better-maps.html)/

Mapillary has a blurring (and reverse blurring) tool  built into their web app to allow users to step in if our automatic blurring algorithms fail. With the blur editor, you are able to blur parts of an image that have been missed or un-blur parts of an image that shouldn't have been blurred.

Mapillary suggest the follwoing should be blurred:

* Faces
* Vehicle license plates
* Inappropriate or private parts of the image (the alternative is to request deletion of the image)

And shouldn't be blurred:

* Whole people
* People from behind when the face is not seen
* Billboards, advertisements, brand labels
* Street, traffic and information signs

Each blurring or unblurring  request help their blurring algorithm learn and improve and is why they provide these recommendations.
