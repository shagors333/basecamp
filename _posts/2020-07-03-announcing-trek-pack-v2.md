**We're ready for summer. So is our kit.**

[In addition to a whole heap of other things](/blog/2020/2020-04-17-what-are-you-working-on), we've spent the last few months improving the Trek Pack for 2020.

The old GoPro Fusion cameras we used have served us well, shooting in temperature ranging from below freezing temperatures to well over 40 degrees. From 20 metres down to 4000 metres up. In rain, snow, and glorious sunshine.

It really is a "take on any adventure" camera.

OK, it wasn't perfect.

One of the biggest gripes with the Fusion was that stitching had to be done off-camera on bundled software, rather than on-camera (like most current cameras in the consumer market).

Trekkers in the field complained about the Fusion Studio software making their computers unusable during stitching process (which can often take hours, even on high performing computers). In fact, some could not use it at all.

[In 2019 we capturer 100,000 images in the UK alone](/blog/2019/year-in-review)... I hate to think how long they took to stitch... and how many times the dreaded "GoPro Fusion Studio has crashed" message was displayed.

[In October last year GoPro released the successor to the Fusion, the GoPro MAX](/blog/2019/2020-04-17-what-are-you-working-on), and we were delighted to hear it was offering on-camera stitching.

## The Trek Pack V2

As such, I'm really excited to announce the next iteration of the Trek Pack today.

The features and specifications of the MAX have not changed much from the Fusion.

Sure, there are better cameras out there, like the a [Insta360 Titan](https://store.insta360.com/product/titan) that shoots crystal clear 11K videp.

But we've been more than happy with the 4K image quality of the Fusion and can't justify the price. What's most important to us; is to get as many cameras into the field as possible,

On-camera stitching, however, was worth its weight in gold to us.

This will make it much easier and faster for people to process their photos and get them online.

Another massive benefit of sticking with GoPro is that all the mounting points are the same which meant we did not need to modify the old trusted backpack design.

But please, please, please GoPro, for the next 360-camera iteration, keep to same battery dimensions!

The MAX battery is a slightly different shape to the old Fusion ones meaning we've had to invest in a whole inventory of spare batteries and chargers for our loan program.

[Whilst battery recycling exists](https://www.recyclenow.com/what-to-do-with/batteries-1), it's not perfect and we'd rather reuse them.
