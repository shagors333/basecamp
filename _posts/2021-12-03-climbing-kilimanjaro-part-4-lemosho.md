**Trek the entire Western face of Kilimanjaro from home.**

In May, we posted our first treks up Kilimanjaro in partnership with [Altezza Travel](https://altezza.travel/en).

* [Macheme Route](/blog/2021/climbing-kilimanjaro-part-2-macheme).
* [Rongai Route](/blog/2021/climbing-kilimanjaro-part-3-rongai).

[The June to October climbing season](/blog/2021/climbing-kilimanjaro-part-1-the-kit) has been incredibly busy for Altezza, so it's been tough finding time to shoot. However, at the start of November a window opened up and the team set their sights on the Lemosho route.

Not too long ago, there were only two main routes used to climb Kilimanjaro – the Marangu (Coca Cola) route and the Machame (Whiskey) route.

But as Tanzania’s tourism industry flourished, the Kilimanjaro park authority created more trails to African’s highest peak to distribute climbers to more areas of the park. This reduced bottlenecks at certain points and also made for a more pleasant experience by limiting crowds

Additionally, these latter trails, like Lemosho were more thoughtfully designed to improve acclimatization for the climber by incorporating longer distances, longer times on the mountain and shorter elevation gains.
