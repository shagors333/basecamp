**It is impossible to argue with the numbers around global warming, but hard to fully comprehend them.**

> Our summers and winters keep getting warmer

> There’s more carbon dioxide in our atmosphere than any time in human history

> Average wildlife populations have dropped by 60 per cent in just over 40 years

They are all scary facts, but hard to quantify.

I don't think this summer was warmer than last.

I don't suffer any adverse effects from CO2.

I have not seen a 60 percent drop in wildlife (though arguably I'm not over 40 either).

No one is to blame for thinking like this. Most people, myself included, find it hard to process data like this.

The problem is, this is one of the biggest reasons so little is being done to tackle climate change.

Over the last decade, Sir David Attenborough documentaries have done an astounding job of both documenting our natural world, and also the rate in which we're destroying it.

These documentaries, and similar works by others, have helped drive a wave of awareness to climate issues.

People are shocked, and in doing so have become more engaged and likely to take action.

Shocked?

Me too.

It's not all bad news though.

Images of destruction inspire us to change.

Images of improvements inspire us to continue.

Like these before and after photos, we believe our historical and current 360-degree records of the natural world will inspire you to take action.
