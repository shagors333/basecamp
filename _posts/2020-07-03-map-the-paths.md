**Let's get exploring**

Land, above sea level, [covers roughly 29 percent, of the earth's surface]https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/how-much-water-there-earth?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects).

The surface area of the earth is 510.1 million km², with land covering 148.9 million km² of that.

Estimates of how much we've explored, both above and below sea level, very widly. In part this is because how "explored” is calculated does not appear to be defined anywhere as a standard.

Say we defined "explored” as "appearing on Google Maps at any zoom level” then 100% of the land on earth is already "explored”.

But what if "explored” means "a human has actually laid eyes on the imagery", the area explored would likely be less than 100%.

Say we define "explored” as "someone has walked withing 100 metres of the area” then again the % drops drastically.

Without getting too philosophical, the generally accepted definition is more towards the latter of the three.

Here's an easier question. How many paths have been explored? Answer; 100%.

And how many have you explored?

OK, I'll stop with the hard questions now.

If you live in a built up area, it's very likely OpenStreetMap has the footpaths, bikepaths, waterways, thanks to user submissions.

Very few have 360, street level imagery.

## Let's get mapping

**Today I'm really excited to officially announce Map the Paths (MTP).**

Map the Paths is a challenge to encourage and reward the collection of new 360 imagery.

This is particularly important for updating maps in fast-changing locations where new cycleways have been constructed, pathways erorded, and so on.

**How it works:**

1. Capture 360 imagery of cycle paths, footpaths, hiking trails, waterways -- essentially anywhere outdoors -- using a non-polluting method of transport.
2. Sign up for an Explorer account and upload your imagery to at least one integration. It does not matter where you upload your imagery too.
3. At the end of each month we will score imagery and award prizes to the winners in each category.

For further details about taking part, the rules, and prizes, please visit the dedicated [Map the Paths website](https://www.mapthepaths.com).
