If you've ever tried using eclectronics in very cold weather you might have wondered why your battery was draining quickly.

When trying to capture footage on a GoPro in the mountains during winter you might have seen this too, or even had issue getting the battery to work at all.

GoPro’s recently announced a new high-performance Enduro battery designed for cold temperatures. The bad news? It's only avaialble for HERO10 and HERO9 action cameras.

## Batteries 101

Batteries use a chemical reaction to make power.

Since chemical reactions slow down in cold weather, all battery types will suffer performance decreases in cold weather.

Lithium-ion (Li-Ion) batteries suffer so badly in freezing temperatures because they have very little internal resistance.

The cold also increases resistance in the battery, meaning it wastes more energy and has to work harder to keep power.

Less resistance means that lithium-ion batteries produce less “waste energy” as heat, but that lack of heat means the batteries don’t perform as well in cold temperatures

The reverse is true hot temperatures. The chemical reactions will increase and the battery may overperform.  Because of this, high temperatures for prolonged periods can actually shorten battery life, as the chemical reactions occur faster.

In short, you should never attempt to use Li-Ion batteries in extreme temperatures as doing so is likely to degrade the battery.

When you need to shoot in cold temperatures, you'll need to find ways to keep your battery warm.

## Designing an Insulated GoPro MAX

The MAX poses some unique challenges when trying to keep the body, and therefore camera warm.

With the HERO cameras the entire top, back and side could be covered in a jacket (which to insulate the camera and prevent it from the external condition. In very cold temperatures you could include heat warmers on the back of the HERO camera to raise the tempetature.

A similar approach is harder with the MAX. There is only a small space between each lens and the camera's body before any jacket will impede the view.

I realised quite quickly, that for optimum conditions I would need to 





When a lithium batteries internal temperature drops below 32 degrees, the lithium cells are unable to accept the same amount of charging current (warmth) as they did when the temperature was warm. Don't charge your lithium batteries when the battery temperature is below freezing.





To give you a reference, with the new HERO10 Black, the 1720mAh lithium-ion Enduro enables the following average recording times at a battery temperature of -10°C:

* 56 minutes of 5.3K60 video 
* 50 minutes of 4K120 video 
* 76 minutes of 4K60 video 
* 115 minutes of 1080p30 video

Meanwhile, for typical outdoor activities at a moderate temperature of 25°C, the HERO10 Black + Enduro combo will enable on average:

* 60 minutes of 5.3K60 video (a 28% improvement over the standard battery) 
* 51 minutes of 4K120 video (a 40% improvement over the standard battery) 
* 71 minutes of 4K60 video (a 13% improvement over the standard battery) 
* 120 minutes of 1080p30 video
