**We can all play a small part in tackling runaway global warming.**

[Fellow Londoner's will have seen the Extinction Rebellion protests over the last few weeks](https://rebellion.earth/event/international-rebellion-uk-action-continues-7-october-2019/). Many of you will have taken part.

Whether you agree with the method of protest or not, I do hope you agree on one thing; each of us needs to play a part to try and limit our impact on the environment.

Small changes add up to big changes. Putting pressure on governments, making considered purchases, small changes to habits / diets, cumulatively all lead to larger changes.

[Plastic bags are a great example of how a small changes in policy and habit can lead to positive environmental results](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/31/shoppers-use-of-plastic-bags-in-england-continues-to-fall).

To me it's not about completely changing your lifestyle. It's about being concious of your impact.

I took some time recently to reassess Trek View's impact on the environment.

We've always aimed to minimise our environmental footprint. [Our Environmental Charter was drawn up to formalise our approach](/charters/environment/).

We only accept camera loans for non-polluting methods of transport. Where possible, we select local trekkers. Most of our equipment is sourced second hand...

But we can always improve.

I've always been sceptical of carbon offsetting. However, I recently listened to a Podcast by Ed Miliband and Geoff Lloyd (Reasons to be Cheerful) titled [TREEDISTRIBUTION: shrubtastic reasons to plant](https://play.acast.com/s/reasonstobecheerful/9dac8b6b-545d-4c3e-84ab-f2c05db7ca15).

In summary;

> Planting billions of trees across the world is by far the biggest and cheapest way to tackle the climate crisis, according to scientists, who have made the first calculation of how many more trees could be planted without encroaching on crop land or urban areas.

- [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/04/planting-billions-trees-best-tackle-climate-crisis-scientists-canopy-emissions)

To me, this is a win-win. Not only will this help tackle climate change, it will give us new woodlands to explore!

In the coming weeks I'm going to research tree planting initiatives that we can donate to (and volunteer with) in order to offset the environmental costs to ship Trek Packs we've sold and loan.

I'll keep you updated.

Though it doesn't end there. Part of the reason for this post is to generate new ideas to reduce our environmental impact. 

Maybe there's a way we can reduce the impact of our technology (especially servers that host our software)? Or a good way to power equipment without reliance on Lithium batteries?

Perhaps you have some suggestions?

We can always improve...
