**Monitoring air quality on the move.**

My Atmotube Pro arrived this week. Needless to say, it didn't take long before I started testing it out.

This post is a short overview of what I found, and why we'll be adding the Atmotube Pro to our Trek Pack setup.

## Unboxing

The device itself is about length and width of a credit card, and has a depth of two modern smartphones (exace measurements: 86 x 50 x 22 mm)

Inside the box you'll recieve:

* Atmotube Pro
* USB-A to USB-C wire (for charging)
* Caribiner (to attach the device to something)

You'll need to download the accompnying AtmoTube mobile app to get it working:

* [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/atmotube/id1080310110?ls=1&mt=8)
* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atmotube.app)

Unlike some devices, the AtmoTube Pro paired (over Bluetooth) with my phone seamlessly.

## Setup

I'm reviewing the AtmoTube Pro as a data collection device.

The AtmoTube Pro has a number of features we're not paticularly interested in. For example, the ability to set an alarm when the air quality drops below a certain level.

The app itself is nicely designed, and generally quite friendly when trying to figure something out.

I wanted to first set the data capture interval to be as granular as possible.

Under setting you can adjust the PM (Particulate Matter) sensor measurement measurement interval to 4 defined settings:

* Always on
* 5 minutes
* 10 minutes
* 15 minutes

For the VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) sensor, I was unable to find a setting that allowed me to change the interval.

Regardless, always on results in a measurement from all sensors being recorded every 1 minute.

Such a large gap between recorded measurements is not ideal, we'd prefer a resolution of at least ten seconds, but I assume this is a tradeoff for battery life in a portable sensor like this.

## Results

I decided to take my AtmoTube Pro out for a bike ride. Living close to a number of airports, air quality is always at the back of my mind as planes fly over.

The results from inside my house, shown in the app screenshot earlier, indicate good air quality.

Though I was keen to understand what it's like outside, and as I moved closer to the airport.

To export the logged data from the app, you can navigate to setting page and select the date range you want the data for.

Once you've selected a date, the app will save a `.csv` file to your phones internal storage. On Android devices, to get to the file go to: Files > Internal Storage > Atmotube
