**Filter and download map features programmatically.**

[Mapillary's Chris Beddow wrote a brilliant blog post about getting started with the Mapillary API](https://blog.mapillary.com/update/2020/08/28/map-data-mapillary-api.html).

I wanted to add some of our favourite API requests for uncovering interesting data.

[We recently ran a mapping party in the New Forest, UK](https://campfire.trekview.org/t/new-forest-pano-party-rescheduled-sunday-13th-september/325).

The photos are great to explore visually to get a feel for the visual beauty of the area. Though the 

A location can be requested via the Mapillary API using a bounding box (`bbox`).

There are lots of tools to calculate coordinates for a bounding box programmatically..

A useful web tool for doing this is [boundingbox.klokantech.com](https://boundingbox.klokantech.com/).

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2020-09-19/bounding-box-draw-web.jpg" alt="Draw a bounding box" title="Draw a bounding box" />

A bounding box is a rectangular box that can be determined by the x and y axis coordinates in the upper-left corner and the x and y  axis coordinates in the lower-right corner of the rectangle.

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2020-09-19/Horizontal-Datums-620x322.png" alt="Latitude / Longitude x/y" title="Latitude / Longitude x/y" />

In mapping terms we can use latitude and longitude for position. 

```
bounding_box=[min_longitude,min_latitude,max_longitude,max_latitude.]
```

My bounding box for the New Forest is: 

```
bounding_box=-1.774513671,50.7038878539,-1.2966083975,50.9385637585
```

You'll notice I drew a polygon on the map, that was converted to a rectangle. This is because bounding boxes are always rectangular. Bounding polygons do exists, but the Mapillary API search endpoints not accept them.

Now we know where we want to analyse, we can run some queries against the Mapillary API.

[I will assume you've already read Chris' post which will show you the basics of forming a request to the Mapillary API](https://blog.mapillary.com/update/2020/08/28/map-data-mapillary-api.html).

One thing to note, you'll not I use the per_page=200 in my requests. This is saying, only show 200 records in the response and then paginate. In many cases, more than 200 records will be returned. In which case you can increase to the maximum record allowed `per_page=1000` (will be slower, and potentially still to small) or use some logic to iterate through each page

Let's start with the the map features endpoint that returns locations of objects as point features on the map. Put another way, the actual real-world position of the object.

Walking takes up a lot of energy. Where can we find a bench (`object--bench`) to sit on?

```
curl "https://a.mapillary.com/v3/map_features?client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>" \
	&layers=lines
	&values=object--bench \
	&bbox=1.774513671,50.7038878539,-1.2966083975,50.9385637585 \
	&per_page=200
```

Here's what the response might look like:

```
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {
        "accuracy": 4.3415914,
        "altitude": 2.1636841,
        "detections": [
          {
            "detection_key": "o8kc5kth6o7m4f5eosebin7od5",
            "image_key": "tsWJOYler98YAmg97kUzLQ",
            "user_key": "_uRM8qupUR4FRNv8sqKR-Q"
          },
          {
            "detection_key": "gq9da6nqktj5rklq5vrc4q8sul",
            "image_key": "39JmaDL9LxsaijLV7n2Ccg",
            "user_key": "KXcBzSdwPIGrXgEP8qdcEQ"
          }
        ],
        "direction": 335.4141,
        "first_seen_at": "2015-07-25T20:01:43.850Z",
        "key": "8yfe7htuqtcd2vrjsxucidqkpl",
        "last_seen_at": "2015-08-08T10:49:33.648Z",
        "layer": "lines",
        "value": "object--bench"
      },
      "geometry": {
        "coordinates": [
          1.774513671,
          50.7038878539
        ],
        "type": "Point"
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Here we see two `feature.detections` (`detection_key=o8kc5kth6o7m4f5eosebin7od5` and `detection_key=gq9da6nqktj5rklq5vrc4q8sul`) of and `object--bench`in one image (`8yfe7htuqtcd2vrjsxucidqkpl`) taken at `latitude=1.774513671` and `longtitude=50.7038878539`.

More images are returned, but for brevity I have omitted from the response printed here (`...`).

Cycling is a very popular activity in the New Forest. How many photos captured within the New Forest contain cyclists (`human--rider--bicyclist`)?

```
curl "https://a.mapillary.com/v3/map_features?client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>" \
	&layers=lines
	&values=human--rider--bicyclist \
	&bbox=1.774513671,50.7038878539,-1.2966083975,50.9385637585 \
	&per_page=200
```

This query only considers people riding bicyles, not all bicycles detected (e.g. parked bicycles). We could add `object--vehicle--bicycle` for this purpose.

Wild ponies can be found all over the New Forest and are a draw for visitors. Being so close to the coast, it's also a great place for bird watching. Let's take an _automated_ look, for them (`animal--bird&animal--ground-animal`):

```
curl "https://a.mapillary.com/v3/map_features?instances?client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>" \
	&layers=lines
	&values=animal--bird&animal--ground-animal \
	&bbox=1.774513671,50.7038878539,-1.2966083975,50.9385637585 \
	&per_page=200
```

If I wanted to filter only images from our Image Mapping Party I could also use the parameters, `usernames=trekviewhq`, `end_first_seen_at=2020-09-12`, `end_last_seen_at=2020-09-14` (the event was held on 2020-09-14).

It's a truly beautiful place in the late-summer to visit, with the leaves still in full bloom.

One of the things we want to do is run another mapping party in the winter to show the visual seasonal differences.

This will also make it possible to provide a rough estimate of canopy cover in summer compared to winter.

The object detections endpoint offers a way to query by the content of images and the area they cover.

Unlike the features endpoint, the object detections endpoint contains coordinates of the in the image detection, but not the specific location of the detected object on a map.

It is also not possible to pass date parameters to this endpoint. Therefore to compare summer and winter, we need to run two queries.

First we need to find all images in the bounding box that were captured_at in the summer months. [For this we can use the `images` endpoint](https://www.mapillary.com/developer/api-documentation/#images):

```

curl "https://a.mapillary.com/v3/images?client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>"
 \
	&start_time=2020-04-01 \
	&end_time=2020-09-30 \
	&bbox=1.774513671,50.7038878539,-1.2966083975,50.9385637585 \
	&per_page=200
```
Here I'm defining summer as the 6 months between the start of April (`2020-04-01`) and the last day of September (`2020-09-30`).

This will return a lot of images each with a `features.key` value. This is the unique Mapillary image key.

We can now use these images keys against the `object_detections` endpoint.

```
https://a.mapillary.com/v3/object_detections/instances?client_id=YOUR CLIENT ID \
	&image_keys=KEY_1,KEY_2,...
	&values=nature--vegetation
	&per_page=200
```

                0.69189453125
              ],
              [
                0.7685546875,
                0.6494140625
              ]
            ]
          ]
        },
        "value": "nature--vegetation"
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
          13.010694722222222,

        ]
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

The features.coordinates show a polygon of the outline of the `nature--vegetation` object.

By calculating the area

IMPORTANT: as noted the `object_detections` endpoint returns detections in each photo (not by individual object). In almost all cases a tree will be covered in more than one photo. Therefore the sum of areas for every image of will include the same object counted potentially many times.

Our plan is to capture images of the same paths but this still makes a like-for-like comparison almost impossible -- unless you can capture images in the winter in exactly the same place.

My _crude_ fix, take the count of photos returned by summer and winter and normaise. E.g if 1000 photos in summer and 500 in winter I will times the sum of area for summer by 0.5 (to account for the 50% reduction in image count in winter).

Hopefully this gives you a few more ideas to build on Chris' post. Please do share the use-cases you're using the Mapillary API for -- I canâ€™t wait to see what new projects will be built on top of it.
