**The days continue to get shorter and the weather colder (in the Northern Hemisphere).**

Crisp and frosty mornings. Dark afternoons. Winter is starting to bite here in the UK.

Getting out onto the water, [like our Trekkers have been doing all summer and autumn](/blog/2019/call-for-trekkers-summer-autumn/), is now only something for the bravest of souls.

Though there are plenty of opportunities for 360-degree photography over the colder months ahead.

## Become a Trekker

I'm looking for Trekkers to help capture new 360-degree tours over the winter and spring.

**The focus is virtual tours of winter sports.**

Ski resorts, mountain passes, glaciers...

With global warming affecting the weather more drastically than ever, I want to get people out capturing landscapes that are changing noticeably every year in an effort to document the changes.

Places where the snow line is retreating, exposed rock under what would once be solid ice, ski lines that will soon be a muddy thing of the past.

I can supply the waterproof 360-degree camera kit. You just need to supply the effort and mode of transport.

If you have a great place that encompasses the theme of winter sports that you want to capture a virtual tour of for others to enjoy, please [apply to the Trek View camera loan program today](/loan) -- I have Trek Packs ready for Trekkers.

**Pro tip:** [Here's some advice when drafting your application](/blog/2019/how-to-make-successful-trek-pack-loan-application/).

If you need a Trek Pack more urgently and are lucky enough to be able to afford to purchase one please do consider [buying one from our store](/store).

[You can also build your own by following our DIY guides](/trek-pack).
