**Building the ultimate data bike**

First we tried the [DIY Street View mountain bike](/blog/2019/diy-street-view-bike-tours/)... it had some limitations and definitely wasn't a bike you wanted to be riding all day.

[Then came the helmet camera](/blog/2020/diy-street-view-bike-v2/)... a nice middleground, but suffered in image quality due to the fact is was mounted on a head that's constantly moving around (and that quickly tires of a heavy weight).

After that we found a brilliant mobile app, [rRuf](/blog/2021/measuring-condition-cycle-paths-phone), for measuring rider comfort. And the [Atmotube Pro]((/blog/2021/measuring-air-quality-portable-part-2)) capable of measuring air quality on the move.

So, wanting to spend the summer out and about we needed to go big this year in order to fit all our toys onto one bike.

Our aim for the bike is to operate in urban and semi-rural locations where riders will be able to return each day.

We had a few requirements:

* Capable of handling various terrain including gravel and mud paths
* Comfortable to ride for a whole day on undulating terrain
* Have suitable mounting points for the equipment
	* Monopod with 360 Camera (GoPro MAX) to capture 360 images for Map the Paths, Google Street View, etc.
	* Action camera (GoPro HERO) to capture images of the ground surface for analysis
	* A smartphone ([with rRuf app](/blog/2021/measuring-condition-cycle-paths-phone)) to measure vibrations for analysis of ground surface condition. It is important this mount point is not dampered by suspension.
	* Portable air-quality sensor ([using Atmotube Pro](/blog/2021/measuring-air-quality-portable-part-2)
	* External power to ensure equipment remains charged.

## Finding a bike

The first debate; what type of bike?

[Our v1 bike was built of a MTB frame](blog/2019/diy-street-view-bike-tours/), but the geometry of these bikes is uncomfortable to ride for a whole day. Same with road bikes.

Touring bikes seemed the best option, specifically designed to remain comfortable whilst covering significant distances each day fully loaded.

Though the weight of kit on our bike would be minimal, we wanted to have a lot of space for the current and any future equipment.

Front suspension was a topic of discussion. Some of us deemed it an unessasary addition, not only because the data bike would usually be on fairly smooth surfaces but also because it might impact the measurements from the rRuf app. 

n the end we decided to keep our minds open on this requirement -- we could always lock the suspension and mount the phone above the rear wheel of the bike. Rear suspension, however, was an absolute no!

The next question; to go electric or not?

The power assistance they offer has saved my legs riding to the top of downhill trails, or just as a backup on smaller hills at the end of a long day.

Our aim is to put these bikes to use almost everyday, for the whole day (up to 100km per day). To ensure riders young and old can operate the bike for the whole day, the aid of an electric motor.

One additional benefit of adding an electric motor is we can also use it to charge some of devices, not having to rely so heavily on external powerpacks.

Yes, they're much heavier, more expensive, and will require charging everyday but we don't expect our data bikes to be venturing out into the wilderness, yet..

After testing a few bikes, we really started to like the Canyon PATHLITE:ON series.

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2021-04-16/full_2021_pathlite-on-7.jpg" alt="PATHLITE:ON 7.0 2021" title="PATHLITE:ON 7.0 2021" />

The top of the line [PATHLITE:ON 9.0](https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/electric-bikes/electric-touring-bikes/pathlite-on/pathlite-on-9.0/2343.html) (£4,999) offers two batteries giving you a range of up to 150km from a single charge. Plus a smorgasbord of clever accessories.

At the other end of the scale, the [PATHLITE:ON 6.0](https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/electric-bikes/electric-touring-bikes/pathlite-on/pathlite-on-6/2799.html) (£2,899) offers a range of up to 100km and many of the accessories seen on the 9.0. 

In between the two are the [PATHLITE:ON 7.0](https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/electric-bikes/electric-touring-bikes/pathlite-on/pathlite-on-7/2800.html) (£3399) and [PATHLITE:ON 8.0](https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/electric-bikes/electric-touring-bikes/pathlite-on/pathlite-on-8.0/2342.html) (£3399). 

As you move up the range (6.0 -> 9.0), the difference in price can mainly be attributed to the higher quality parts and dual batteries on the 8.0 and 9.0 models.

Going for the 9.0 on longer distance adventures makes sense, however, for us, the 7.0 more than meets requirements.

One of the reasons we chose the 7.0 over the 6.0 was the included rack. Of course, it is possible to fit your own rack to the 6.0.
