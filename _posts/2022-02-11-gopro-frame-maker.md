**Once you've shot a video on the MAX, you will need to process it using GoPro Studio. Here are our recommended settings.**

When out with the Trek Pack, we recommend capturing content in video mode.

Videos shot on the MAX are processed using GoPro Studio software.

GoPro Studio has a small, but useful, set of features for post-processing, espeically when it comes to creating virtual tours of the outdoors where the camera is mounted to your body.

In this post I wanted to share the settings we tend to use, and why we use them.


## World Lock


World lock is a feature that allows you to lock the view of the camera throughout the footage.

As a simple example, if I start recording facing North, with World Lock set to true in GoPro Studio, the entire footage will always face North.

It's a useful mode if the camera it rotating significantly.

To hightlight when it's useful, here are two examples I filmed; one where I hung the MAX from a string and let it spin, the other from a recording cycling around my block.

### World Lock = True

### Do Not Use World Lock for Virtual Tours

We always set World Lock to false.

Using the Trek Pack, the camera is mostly facing in the same way as trekker, and it is this view we want to have as the default when viewed by the user. With no significant rotation, world lock negatively affects users.


## Horizon Level

Horizon Level is a very similar feature to World Lock, however, instead of locking onto the same compass heading, Horizon Level locks the camera onto the horizon.

Enabling Horizon Level does take away from the immersiveness of the action, but means the camera is not swaying from left to right during footage (which can be especially problematic when the MAX is mounted to a helmet). 

### Horizon Level = True




### Horizon Level = False



### Use Horizon Level for Virtual Tours

Horizon Level ensures your videos are always level with the horizon. Levelling the footage offers a much better viewing experience as users are most used to seeing level content.
