**Mapillary, OpenStreetMap, JSOM, iD....**

Many of you might be familiar with the OpenStreetMap [iD Editor](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ID), the [Java OpenStreetMap (JSOM) editor](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Comparison_of_editors#JOSM), or perhaps [an entirely different editor altogether](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Comparison_of_editors).

Many thousands of contributors use it to add and update community submitted map data that powers OpenStreetMap (OSM).

For JOSM, a desktop application, [there are lots available](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Plugins). From [ColorPlugin](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Plugins/Color_Plugin) that provides functionality to put the 'color' attribute for roof and walls of the buildings, to â€‹[TombPlugin](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/JOSM/Plugins/Tomb_Plugin), a simple plugin for tagging tombs.

That GIF above, taken from the introduction linked above, shows a good example of how satellite imagery from Mapbox can help users make edits to the map (e.g adding buildings).

And of course, [the Mapillary plugin](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Plugins/Mapillary) that allows JSOM user to work with Mapillary images to provide additional context when editing the map.

The Java OpenStreetMap Editor, often simply refered to by the acronym JOSM, is a free software desktop editing tool for OpenStreetMap geodata.

If you're unfamiliar with JOSM, [this introduction will quicly guide you to your first successful OSM edit](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Introduction).



JSOM benefits from a modular plugin based design.

People can build plugins that can be installed on JSOM to improve and enhance its capabilities for improving map data.
