**The easy way!**

[A little over a year ago now I wrote about a small piece of software we built, Tourer](/blog/2019/diy-google-street-view-part-5-uploading-photos-using-your-computer), that allowed you to upload images to Google Street View and other panoramic image hosting sites.

It did the job we needed it to do, but it was cluncky, required some technical knowledge and in short, had lots of room to be improved. In that post I teased of a simpler version, with a UI interface.

Admittidly, slightly later than planned, here it is; the Map the Paths Desktop Uploader.

Here's what it can currently do:

* Add metadata to Sequences for easy management and discovery (name, description, tags)
* Add metadata to photos (copyright, artist name...)
* Convert video to photo frames
* Geotag photo files using a .gpx track
* Modify the GPS track of the photos including;
	- Define photo spacing
	- Modify position
	- Modify heading
	- Remove unwanted photos
* Upload and add a nadir to photos
* Blur people and license plates
* Upload to web platforms
	- Map the Paths Web
	- Mapillary
	- Google Street View
	- Strava (`.gpx` track)
	- Developer? [Add your own...](https://guides.trekview.org/mtp-desktop-uploader/developer-docs/integrations)
