First we tried the [DIY Street View mountain bike](/blog/2019/diy-street-view-bike-tours/)... it had some limitations and definatley wasn't a bike you wanted to be riding all day.

[Then came the helmet camera](/blog/2020/diy-street-view-bike-v2/)... a nice middleground, but suffered in image quality due to the fact is was mounted on a head that's constantly moving around (and that quickly tires of a heavy weight).

So, wanting to spend the summer out and about we needed to go big this year.

Our aim for the bike is to operate in urban and semi-rural locations where riders will be able to return each day.

We had a few requirements:

* Capable of handling various terrain including gravel and mud paths
* Comfortable to ride for a whole day on undulating terrain
* Have suitable mounting points for the equipment
	* Monopod with 360 Camera (GoPro MAX) to capture 360 images for Map the Paths, Google Street View, etc.
	* Action camera (GoPro HERO) to capture images of the ground surface for analysis
	* A smartphone ([with rRuf app](/blog/2021/measuring-condition-cycle-paths-phone)) to measure vibrations for analysis of ground surface condition. It is important this mount point is not dampered by suspension.
	* Portable air-quality sensor ([using Atmotube Pro](/blog/2021/measuring-air-quality-portable)
	* External power to ensure equipment remains charged.

## Finding a bike

The first debate; what type of bike?

[Our v1 bike was built of a MTB frame](blog/2019/diy-street-view-bike-tours/), but the geometry of these bikes is uncomfortable to ride for a whole day. Same with road bikes.

We looked at touring bikes, designed to cover significant distances each day with significant loads. 

Though in the back of our mind, we thought about extensibity


The next question; to go electric or not?

The power assistance they offer has saved my legs riding to the top of downhill trails, or just as a backup on smaller hills at the end of a long day.

Our aim is to put these bikes to use almost everday, for the whole day. To ensure riders young and old can operate the bike for the whole day, the aid of an electric motor 

Yes, they're much heavier, more expensive, and will require charging everyday
