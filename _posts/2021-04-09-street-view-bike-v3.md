First we tried the [DIY Street View mountain bike](/blog/2019/diy-street-view-bike-tours/)... it had some limitations and definatley wasn't a bike you wanted to be riding all day.

[Then came the helmet camera](/blog/2020/diy-street-view-bike-v2/)... a nice middleground, but suffered in image quality due to the fact is was mounted on a head that's constantly moving around (and that quickly tires of a heavy weight).

So, wanting to spend the summer out and about we needed to go big this year.

We had a few requirements:

* Capable of handling various terrain including gravel and mud paths
* Comfortable to ride for a whole day
* Have suitable mounting points for the equipment
	* Monopod with 360 Camera (GoPro MAX) to capture 360 images for Map the Paths, Google Street View, etc.
	* Action camera (GoPro HERO) to capture images of the ground surface for analysis
	* A smartphone ([with rRuf app](/blog/2021/measuring-condition-cycle-paths-phone)) to measure vibrations for analysis of ground surface condition. It is important this mount point is not dampered by suspension.
	* Portable air-quality sensor
	* External power pack to ensure equipment remains charged.

## The first debate; to go electric?

Electric bikes are amazing these days. I've rode downhill mountain bikes in
