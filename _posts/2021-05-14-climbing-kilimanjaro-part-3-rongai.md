**Time for another virtual 7 day hike**

[Last week saw us embark on a virtual expedition on the Macheme Route](/blog/2021/climbing-kilimanjaro-part-2-macheme).

This week we'll be tackling the Rongai Route.

Due to the remote location of its trailhead, Rongai is seldom visited by the trekkers.

It takes a long four-hour drive from the Moshi town (a popular travel hub) to get there. Yet, the experiences on Rongai are rewarding - the only route approaching Kilimanjaro from the North, it offers sheerly different vegetation and landscapes from what a one can see on the other Kilimanjaro route.   

## Rainforest zone

The rainforest zone on the Rongai route is somewhat special from this zone in the south, east of west - it does not receive so much rainfall, and here the hikers have a chance to see coniferous trees.

## Heather and Moorland

At around 2800 m the heather and moorland zone begins. This is where the rainforest zone recedes, eventually giving way to heather. The higher we go, the less thick vegetation becomes.

## Alpine desert

Alpine (or Highland) desert starts at 4000 m. These fields look empty and desolated. This area gets the least rainfall of all - less than 8 inches every year. The vegetation is meagre, as very few plants can handle burning say at daytime and subzero temperatures at night.

## Arctic Zone

<iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://embed-v1.mapillary.com/embed?version=1&filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&map_filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&map_style=Mapillary streets&image_key=uHjX6CHTzySqoRYbC5kPyV&client_id=M1E0WHVYcHZUdUI3Q0l0VThuNnU0ajo2OTY0ZWUzZDZlODY2OWI3&style=classic" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The Arctic zone starts at 5000m and tops at Uhuru Peak at 5,895m. Its lower area is known as “scree” - the mass of loose pebble, gravel and soil. It is one of the reasons why all summits start at night - low temperatures freeze pieces of this scree together, making it less loose and allowing the boots to have better traction.

## Altezza Travel

This Guidebook would not have been possible without the studious team at Altezza Travel.

They're taking bookings for the 2021 season, including the Rogai route. [See the Altezza Travel website for more details](https://en.altezza.travel/).

## More soon...

Sadly we could only able to film two treks ([see the Macheme Route here](/blog/2021/climbing-kilimanjaro-part-2-macheme))) due to timings over the January to March trekking season. 

When the good weather for trekking returns again in June, we'll be hoping for a few more drier days to [capture the missing imagery with our Trek Packs](/trek-pack).
