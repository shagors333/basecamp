**From the South Coast to the Yorkshire Dales.**

In 2019 our trekkers captured over 100,000 360-degree photos around England alone.

We've captured tours of rivers, lakes, footpaths and mountains.

Here are five tours I've been fortunate enough to shoot in the UK this year. I hope you like them.

## The River Thames, England

Transport type: SUP

346 km in total. I covered about 100 km this year between Oxford and Kew on a paddle-board. From big cities and million Pound mansions to rolling hills and farm yards.

## Wey Navigations, England

Transport type: SUP

My "local" river. Passing through the beauty of the Surrey countryside from  Godalming to Weybridge where it joins the Thames. My only complaint -- navigating through the many locks! Life could be worse.

## The South Downs Way, England

Transport type: Hike

I wasn't brave enough to tackle it in one go. In fact, I'm yet to complete it. By my estimations I've covered half of it, 80km, each kilometre of which was beautiful.

## High Cup Nick, England

<iframe width="600" height="450" src="https://embed-v1.mapillary.com/embed?version=1&filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&map_filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&map_style=Mapillary streets&image_key=euagyFulrHmGV-yl-cTngQ&x=0.5083722362938256&y=0.5406275327123344&client_id=cEc2TDVkajU3UEF1eGFFVVVnajloQTpkNGUyMTY3ZjlhOTg0NTVl&style=classic" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Transport type: Hike

A short visit to the Yorkshire dales allowed me to finally hike around High Cup Nick. Though it was a little cloudy, the imposing valley provided one of my favourite walks of the year.

## The Devil's Punchbowl, England

<iframe width="600" height="450" src="https://embed-v1.mapillary.com/embed?version=1&filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&map_filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&map_style=Mapillary streets&image_key=DY_MC9UaS7JBsGlX0i-oww&x=0.3593339156375899&y=0.6141097131108534&client_id=cEc2TDVkajU3UEF1eGFFVVVnajloQTpkNGUyMTY3ZjlhOTg0NTVl&style=classic" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Transport type: Hike

This is one of my favourite places in Southern England. It was a staple in my childhood as it is today in my adult life. Views from Hindhead all the way to London (about 60km) -- the Shard skyscraper makes the city a little easier to find these days.

## Onwards and upwards to 2020

And sideways and downwards, and all over.

In 2020 my aim is to capture over 10 million 360-degree photos, from at least 20 countries.

We're working on exciting new products for 2020 to make it easy for everyone to explore 360-degree tours of the natural world.

But I need your help...
