**Climb. Ski. Hike. Bike. Paddle. Run. Travel.**

I love podcasts.

I've been wanting to create one for a while, but wasn't quite sure where to start.

After much research -- too much research -- ExPODition is our first foray into the podcasting world (very late, I know!).

Every two weeks I'm going to be talking with 'everyday people' who have embarked on amazing adventures.

In some ways it's to fulfil my own lockdown wonderlust, but I am certain the people I speak with will inspire many of you too.

And the first episode is a corker!

British adventurer Chris Lucas and his actor father Niall, depend on each other for survival, as they canoe down one of the most remote rivers in Canada. The Yukon Assignment is a breath-taking exploration of one of the Earthâ€™s last wildernesses and the story of how adventure can bring us together, irrespective of age.

In the first episode of ExPODition I talk with British adventurer Chris Lucas about canoing down one of the most remote rivers in Canada with his father.
