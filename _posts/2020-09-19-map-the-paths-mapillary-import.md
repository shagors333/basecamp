Over the past 1.5 years, we've submitted about 2000 of our own sequences to Mapillary.

Our trekkers have submitted many more.

The problem with holding such a large amount of imagery is making it easily searchable.

Last year I took my paddleboard down the Thames ([you might have seen my Map the Path Guidebook](https://mtp.trekview.org/guidebook/420e3f78-8c6d-4b9e-9c29-0217c8394570/detail/)). 

Keen paddleboarders might have found this imagery previously by browsing images of the River Thames on Mapillary.

Problem is, most paddleboarders will not have.

Nor hikers looking for days out, cyclists planning their routes, skiiers looking for new pistes, and many others wanting to explore the outdoors through street-level imagery.

I want to be able to direct these people to our imagery they're most interested in and will find most useful.

When we announced Map the Paths Guidebooks two weeks ago, many of you dropped me an email to share things you've learned from our Guidebooks -- keep them coming.

But they didn't give the whole (_360 degree_) picture...

## Introducing Sequences and Tours

From today, you'll also be able to import Mapillary sequence data into Map the Paths.

First thing first, let me be clear; we're not trying to replace Mapillary, far from it.

Think of imported sequences as a discovery tool for your Mapillary images.

By importing Mapillary sequence data to Map the Paths you can classify it with a title, description, how it was captured (transport method), and searchable tags.

Any Map the Paths visitor can then discover your sequences through search. For example,

> "Show me images captured in the UK by electric bike"

You can also group Sequence as Tours. Tours are groups of Sequences.

For example, if you have 10 distinct sequences of a trail you've hiked, you can group them as a Tour and call it "My hike of the South West Coast Path".

Once you've imported your imagery, share you Map the Paths profile on social media so your network can recreate the adventures you've been on.

And every Mapillary sequnce imported boosts you're position on the new Map the Paths leaderboard.

You'll score leaderboard points for the number of photos imported to Map the Paths based on quality and capture method.

We've also added the ability for Map the Paths users to mark individual photos as Viewpoints. Users can mark your images as Viewpoints to indicate a paticulary impressive photo. You'll score points for the more Viewpoints your photos have recieved.

And points win prizes... more on that soon.

You can start creating your own Guidebooks on Map the Paths now.

Check out the trekviewhq profile to find out where we've been recently.

Please do share Sequences and Tours you've imported to Map the Paths with us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/trekview/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/trekview). I'll make sure we repost as many as possible.

Now, get exploring!
