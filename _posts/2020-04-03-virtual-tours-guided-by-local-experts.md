**Calling all armchair adventurers! Join us for a series of virtual tours to the world's most awe inspiring places.**

Over the last 2 weeks we've been [taking students on virtual field trips](/blog/2020/treehouse-academy-emergency-timetable/) to places like Mount Everest and the Great Barrier Reef.

To quote one parent:

> "It would be amazing to have someone guide me on a virtual tour so I could learn about the Great Barrier Reef whilst stuck at home too".

Ask and you will receive.

Given the success of our [virtual lessons for children](/blog/2020/treehouse-academy-emergency-timetable/) and [virtual tour guides of local areas](/case-studies/2020/gb/north-east-hampshire/), today were extending the concept to include free, live, virtual guided tours to some of the most astounding landscapes around the world for anyone, anywhere.

## About the tours

Virtual tourists will be able to join virtually guided tours, led by local experts, of the Great Barrier Reef, the Galapagos Islands, Machu Picchu, and the Arctic.

A PC (with speakers / headphones to listen), tablet or mobile device that are connected to the internet is all that virtual tourists will need.

Tours are completely free-of charge to join.

Virtual tourists will also have the opportunity to ask their questions to tour guides during each expedition.

All tours are guided in English, but people from anywhere in the world are encouraged to join us.

Tours are scheduled to run until the end of April.
