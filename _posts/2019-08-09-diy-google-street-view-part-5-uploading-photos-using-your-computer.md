**Share your 360-degree tours with the world.**

## Existing Street View Upload options

Taking one or two 360-degree photos on your phone and uploading to Google Street View is simple. Google have built Street View apps for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.street) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/google-street-view/id904418768) devices.

Other cameras I considered before selecting the GoPro Fusion, such as the [Ricoh Theta V](https://theta360.com/en/about/theta/v.html), upload to Street View automatically when connected to your phone (with the Street View app installed).

Though when it comes to uploading a larger number of photos or streaming video from powerful 360-degree cameras, even the Theta V can struggle (usually the limitation is your phone in processing the data).

The other alternative has been to get technical, with a good knowledge of programming required to interact with the [Google Street View publish API](https://developers.google.com/streetview/publish/).

## Introducing the Explorer Desktop Uploader

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blog/2019-08-09/explorer-desktop-uploader-command-line-tools-example.jpg" alt="Trek View  Explorer Desktop Uploader CLI Example" title="Trek View Explorer Desktop Uploader CLI Example" />

To solve this problem, we have built a small piece of software to make it fairly simple (albeit for now with some technical knowledge) to upload a large number of 360-degree photos to Google Street View.

[Today we're releasing it as open-source piece to the community](https://github.com/trek-view/explorer-desktop-uploader).

Download and run it on your computer (Windows, Mac, and Linux) to publish 360-degree photos to Street View using your Google account.

To help you get up up-and-running quickly with the Explorer Desktop Uploader we've [created a detailed guide describing how to use the software to publish your photos to Street View](https://github.com/trek-view/explorer-desktop-uploader/wiki).

As noted, it does require some level of technical knowledge. The software is currently a set of command line tools.

This release of the Explorer Desktop Uploader can be classed as an alpha version. Simply put, there will probably be bugs in the software. Please let us know if you encounter any errors by [contacting us via email](/contact) or [raising an issue on GitLab](https://github.com/trek-view/explorer-desktop-uploader/issues).

## The Explorer Desktop Uploader Roadmap

I'm working hard to make the Explorer Desktop Uploader easier to use for non-technical users. The next release will provide a friendlier installation process and a visual interface to manage tours.

Do you want to be the first to know when the next version of the Explorer Desktop Uploader is released?

## Help us Improve the Explorer Desktop Uploader

If you're technical and have a few ideas up your sleeve; why not help improve the Explorer Desktop Uploader for everyone?

The Explorer Desktop Uploader software is provided as open-source under an AGPL v3 license. The [source code for the Explorer Desktop Uploader can be accessed here](https://github.com/trek-view/explorer-desktop-uploader).
