**Coastal communities, long distance hiking trails, biking maps, building detection, and Irish heritage.**

State of the Map 2021 took place online this year, from July 9 to 11 2021.

There were some brilliant talks at this years conference, [now available to watch back on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQNy8KsDknCoq3AkVd5Nlgtwp1fnAWOcn).

[The full programme can be viewed here](https://2021.stateofthemap.org/programme/).

I've curated some of my favourite talks most closely linked to the work we do here at Trek View that I know you'll enjoy.

[_Don't forget to check out my favourite talks from last year too_](/blog/2020/state-of-the-map-2020).


## Improving OSM Data in Coastal Communities

Over the past few years, the world has been experiencing the impacts of climate change with an increase in extreme weather events.

Coastal communities are among the most vulnerable and face a range of unique flooding hazards including storm surge, wave impact, and erosion causing damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.

This talk by Monica Brandeis covers OSM data quality in coastal communities.

## Building a global outdoor map

[MapTiler Outdoor](https://docs.maptiler.com/schema/outdoor/) is a global dataset and a map style for hiking and biking available as a zoomable and web-compatible vector tiles, which are ready for use in OpenLayers, MapLibre, Leaflet, QGIS as well as mobile applications.

Jiri Komarek describes the challenges him and his team members encountered whilst bulding MapTiler: most of them originating from a need to create a rigid set of rules for the entire world, which is full of diversity due to the variety of nature.

## Building a Free Worldwide Long Distance Hiking Trail Map Together With OpenStreetMap

Dozens if not hundreds of users worldwide have contributed a wealth of long-distance hiking trail information to OpenStreetMap. However, this data is difficult to extract in a meaningful and useful way and its quality varies greatly.

This talk by Davey Lovin introduces [superroute](https://superroute.org/): an interactive webmap and quality assurance tool for OSM long distance hiking trails, with the goal of coalescing a community of passionate data-nerdy hikers to maintain and improve the data quality of these trails for the benefit of all.

In this talk, Hao Li shares recent work in detecting OpenStreetMap missing buildings and shows you a walkthrough on how to train your own building detector using ohsome2label and the TensorFlow Object Detection API.

Since Anne-Karoline Distel moved to Ireland from Germany in December 2016, she has been mapping heritage features on the island.

Shortly after becoming a member of a local historical society, she started mapping historical features like ringforts, castles, church ruins and graveyards.
