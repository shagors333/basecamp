**Rainforest's, moorland, glaciers, and volcanic craters.**

If you missed last weeks post, [we're in the process of mapping Kilimanjaro with our Trek Packs](/blog/2021/climbing-kilimanjaro-part-1-the-kit).

For our first trek our guide and cameraman, Joshua, would be tackling the Macheme route.

Also known as the _Whiskey_ route, it is the second most popular route on Mount Kilimanjaro.

It starts in the tropical rainforest, approaches the peak area through the southern face of Mt Kilimanjaro and summit is done through Barafu Summit Camp. Descent is done through Mweka Route. 

## Start of the Hike

The Altezza Travel team drive out to the start point to the start of the hike, just outside the town of Macheme from which the route takes its name.

## Rainforest (1,800m)

<iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://embed-v1.mapillary.com/embed?version=1&filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&map_filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&map_style=Mapillary streets&image_key=xF0ZHcGPd5jMi8WW0fDzkq&client_id=M1E0WHVYcHZUdUI3Q0l0VThuNnU0ajo2OTY0ZWUzZDZlODY2OWI3&style=classic" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Moss-covered trees, seas of ferns and elusive monkeys abound in the rainforests that surround the mountain.

## Moorland (3,000m)

<iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://embed-v1.mapillary.com/embed?version=1&filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&map_filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&map_style=Mapillary streets&image_key=PCXLvfrqSkxDkKF6NBrW1J&client_id=M1E0WHVYcHZUdUI3Q0l0VThuNnU0ajo2OTY0ZWUzZDZlODY2OWI3&style=classic" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The thick rainforest starts to thin out. At an altitude of almost 3,000 meters (around 9,800 ft) you have arrived at the beginning of the moorland. Shorter trees as well as an increasing number of ferns and mosses are typical for this vegetation zone.

## Alpine desert (4,000m)

<iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://embed-v1.mapillary.com/embed?version=1&filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&map_filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&map_style=Mapillary streets&image_key=thDxDIT4RebAMqDmC10wKx&client_id=M1E0WHVYcHZUdUI3Q0l0VThuNnU0ajo2OTY0ZWUzZDZlODY2OWI3&style=classic" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Now you have arrived at an altitude of about 4,000 meters (around 13,100 ft). The ascent is mostly less steep than before, and youâ€™re walking on paths across seemingly endless expanses and scree fields.

## Volcanic Craters (5,000m)

<iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://embed-v1.mapillary.com/embed?version=1&filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&map_filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&map_style=Mapillary streets&image_key=acDWP4j4Al6MwKgU1wUdBm&client_id=M1E0WHVYcHZUdUI3Q0l0VThuNnU0ajo2OTY0ZWUzZDZlODY2OWI3&style=classic" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Kilimanjaro has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi and Shira. Kibo, the youngest and highest, retains the form of a typical volcanic cone and crater.

## Uhuru Peak (5,895m)

Congratulations you are now at Uhuru Peak, Tanzania. 5895 AMSL.

## End of the Trek

<iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://embed-v1.mapillary.com/embed?version=1&filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&map_filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&map_style=Mapillary streets&image_key=m17jqnyuuoPgifvrau1hEl&client_id=M1E0WHVYcHZUdUI3Q0l0VThuNnU0ajo2OTY0ZWUzZDZlODY2OWI3&style=classic" frameborder="0"></iframe>

6 or 7 days later, we leave the park just outside the town of Mweka. Time for a well deserved rest in one of the many hotels and resorts in Tanzania.

## Altezza Travel

Machame is the second most popular route on Mt Kilimanjaro after Marangu. More than one third of all Kilimanjaro climbers do it through Machame. It is available in two variations - six and seven days, with the latter option known to have better acclimatization transition.

This Guidebook would not have been possible without the studious team at Altezza Travel.

They're taking bookings for the 2021 season, including the Macheme route. [See the Altezza Travel website for more details](https://en.altezza.travel/).

## More soon...

Sadly the weather meant we couldn't film the entire Macheme route. 

When the good weather for trekking returns again in June, we'll be hoping for a few more drier days to [capture the missing imagery with our Trek Pack](/trek-pack).

Next week I'll be sharing Joshua's imagery from the Mweka Route...
