**This event has now been cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak.**

**2020-08-19 Update**

This event has been rescheduled for Sunday 13th September 2020. I hope to see you there.

**2020-03-13 Update**

Hi everyone!

In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and updated advice from health services, we've cancelled upcoming pano party.

It is our intention to reschedule when the situation becomes more clear, but for now our first priority is the safety of everyone including attendees and members of the local community.

Stay safe and well!

**First question; what is a pano party?**.

[Trekkers collected over 100k 360-degree photos using Trek Packs in 2019](/blog/2019/year-in-review).

Now 2020 is well under-way, we're concious of our target to capture over 10 million 360-degree photos.

Simply put, we need your help.

One of the ways I think we can reach this ambitious goal is through [Mapping Parties](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_parties).

Mapping parties are social mapping events in which OpenStreetMap mappers come together, cross their fingers for good weather, to intensively map a specific area.

As well as being a great way of quickly producing mapping for a particular area, they are also a great opportunity for mappers to get together and socialise.

A mapping party typically begins with a morning planning session in which sub-sections of the mapping area are allocated, and then each mapper goes off in a different direction and maps their allocated area.

At the end of the day, everyone gets together, reviews progress and - if wi-fi is available - edits the map.

## Pano Party 

The name is different. The concept is the same.

* **When**: Saturday 23rd May (start time 11AM)
* **Where**: The New Forest (meeting at Ashurst (New Forest) Railway Station)

During the Pano Party we'll be following a similar plan - to take 360-degree photos of as many paths as we can in the Ashurst area, to produce a 360 map of the trails in this beautiful area which can be walked virtually in each direction.

We chose the location with transport in mind. Regular trains run from London to Southampton, and then on to Ashurst (New Forest).

Our plan is to start at 11AM (aim to arrive 15 minutes before this). The days will be much longer towards the end of May so this still gives us plenty of time for mapping. I'll be there from 930AM if you're an early riser too.

The Monday (25th May) is also a bank holiday. Perhaps a long weekend for those travelling from further away?

We'll provide the [Trek Packs](/trek-pack), you need to provide the energy.

Everyone is welcome to join us from children, pets, grandparents...

## RSVP

It's still early days and specifics are yet to be finalised.

At present, we're trying to assess numbers, where people will be travelling from, and how they plan to travel.
