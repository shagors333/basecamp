Out fourth bi-annual "Call for Trekkers".

Recapping on the previous calls:

* [Summer / Autumn 2019: Water Sports](/blog/2019/call-for-trekkers-summer-autumn)
* [Winter / Spring 2020: Winter Sports](/blog/2019/call-for-trekkers-winter-spring)
* [Summer / Autumn 2020: Local Areas](/blog/2020/call-for-trekkers-summer-autumn)

You might notice this is somewhat biased to people living in the higher Northern Hemisphere.

Well, [for anyone below the 30 parrallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude), good news.

As many of us in colder climates can only dream of Winter sun with ongoing travel restrictions, you can bring the sun to us.

## Become a Trekker

I'm looking for Trekkers to help capture new 360-degree tours over the winter and spring (in the Northern Hemisphere).

**The focus is on winter sun.**

My focus is on environmentally focused business that have veen hit hard due to the drop in tourism.

Perhaps you have a small business on a beautiful beach front or nested deep in a forest and want to show it off to the world.

We can supply the 360-degree camera kit. You just need to supply the effort and mode of transport.

If you you want to capture a virtual tour of for others to enjoy, please [apply to the Trek View camera loan program today](/loan) -- I have Trek Packs ready for Trekkers.

Got another project in mind? That's OK too. I still encourage you to [submit an application to loan one of our Trek Packs](/loan).

**Pro tip:** [Here's some advice when drafting your application](/blog/2019/how-to-make-successful-trek-pack-loan-application/).

Alternatively, [you can build your own Trek Pack by following these instructions](/trek-pack).
