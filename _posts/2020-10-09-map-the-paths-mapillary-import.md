**Curate and share your street-level images**

Over the past 1.5 years, we've submitted about 100's of thousands of images to Mapillary.

Our trekkers have submitted many more.

The problem with holding such a large amount of imagery is making it easily searchable and finding the best moments from the journey.

Last year I took my paddleboard down the Thames ([you might have seen my Map the Path Guidebook](https://mtp.trekview.org/guidebook/b27cb503-89f7-4e75-8fd0-9ba11444e8fb/detail/)). 

We are continuing our mission to direct these people to our imagery they're most interested in.

[When we announced Map the Paths Guidebooks in August](/blog/2020/map-the-paths-guidebooks), many of you dropped me an email to share things you've learned from our Guidebooks -- keep them coming.

But they didn't give the whole (_360 degree_) picture...

## Introducing Sequences and Tours

From today, you'll also be able to import Mapillary images into Map the Paths.

First thing first, let me be clear; we're not trying to replace Mapillary, far from it.

Think of imported sequences as a discovery tool for your Mapillary images.

By importing Mapillary sequence data to Map the Paths you can classify it with a title, description, how it was captured (transport method), and searchable tags.

This means any Map the Paths visitor can then discover your sequences through search. For example,

> "Show me images captured in the Netherlands by bicycle"

[Here's the link you'll need](https://mtp.trekview.org/sequence/list?page=1&username=&name=&transport_type=12&tag=netherlands).

You can also group Sequence as Tours. Tours are groups of Sequences.

For example, if you have 10 distinct sequences of a trail you've hiked, you can group them as a Tour.

[Here's a Tour of my hike to the Buenavista del Norte Lighthouse in Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain](https://mtp.trekview.org/tour/69cca732-1400-4392-b04a-5be19bf524a4/detail).

Once you've imported your imagery, share you Map the Paths profile on social media so your network can recreate the adventures you've been on.

[Shameless plug](https://mtp.trekview.org/user/himynamesdave/profile/).

And every Mapillary sequence imported boosts you're position on the new Map the Paths leaderboard.

You'll score leaderboard points for the number of photos imported to Map the Paths based on quality and capture method.

We've also added the ability for Map the Paths users to mark individual photos as Viewpoints. Users can mark your images as Viewpoints to indicate a particularly impressive photo. You'll score points for the more Viewpoints your photos have received.

[Check out the leaderboards to see where you rank](https://mtp.trekview.org/leaderboard/).

And points win prizes... more on that soon.

[You can start importing your Mapillary images to Map the Paths NOW](https://mtp.trekview.org/sequence/import-sequence).

Please do share Sequences and Tours you've imported to Map the Paths with us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/trekview/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/trekview). I'll make sure we repost as many as possible.

I do hope you've got a few more adventures planned before winter sets in!
