	<h3>What is Trek View?</h3>

	<p>Hi! I'm <a href="https://www.himynamesdave.com/" target="_blank">Dave</a>.</p>

	<p>Back in 2019 I took a 360-degree camera and started filming hiking trails.</p>

	<p>They quickly attracted millions of views online and other hikers asked me how they could do the same. <a href="/blog/2019/diy-google-street-view-part-1-how-trek-view-started/">So I showed them</a>.</p>

	<p>I created VR apps for schools allowing school children to go on virtual field trips -- many of whom had never left the cities in which they lived.</p>

	<p>Then local community groups, larger commercial organisations and even some celebrities wanted to use the photos for their own environmental causes.</p>

	<p>At the same time, I became interested in computer vision, the ability to train a computer to automatically classify what's inside an image.</p>

	<p>I quickly realised the potential for using this data to understand the environment at scale was huge.</p>

	<p>And so Trek View became a thing.</p>

	<p><em>I originally wanted to call it Trail View, <a href="https://trailview.org/" target="_blank">but a church was already using the domain name</a>!</em></p>

	<p><strong>"You can't protect what you don't understand"</strong></p>

	<p><strong>"People won't change unless they care"</strong></p>

	<p>Now we're a team of <a href="/about/team">core staff</a> and <a href="/loan">volunteers</a> with a passion for the outdoors.</p>

	<p>Here at Trek View, we believe that immersive visual street-level records of our natural world will help:</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Build people's empathy for and understanding of the world's biggest environmental issues to spark their curiosity and trigger their engagement on the topics.</li>
			<li>Give organisations and communities the ability to market themselves on the world's stage to promote sustainable tourism rather than environmental destruction.</li>
			<li>Boost local economies by attracting investors to create high-quality job opportunities for local populations.</li>
			<li>Capture environments at risk of being lost, through natural or man-made means, and to expose the damage being done using historical records.</li>
			<li>Provide researchers with large data sets that can be used to help understand the health of the environment to generate solutions to protect it.</li>
			<li>Deliver accurate information on the location of people and infrastructure in emergency situations, to help organisations understand their needs and plan the response.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h3>How is Trek View imagery used?</h3>

	<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/global/trek-view-image-recognition-lg.jpg" alt="Trek View Image Recognition" title="Trek View Image Recognition" />

	<p><a href="https://greenhouse.trekview.org" target="_blank">Here at Trek View</a>, alongside our research partners, use computer vision to classify what's inside an image, from species of trees and their health, to coastal erosion and its impact.</li>

	<p>Our imagery is also viewed by over 200,000 people each month and is used for:</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Virtual Exploration: You can <a href="/loan">loan a 360-degree camera</a> and/or upload your own 360-degree tour imagery using <a href="https://github.com/trek-view" target="_blank">our software</a> to share and inspire others around the world.</li>
			<li>K12 Education: Teachers use <a href="https://treehouse.trekview.org" target="_blank">our virtual field trips and live video calls with researchers in the field</a> to provide students with an interactive way to cover curriculum content.</li>
			<li>Sustainable Tourism: Commercial organisations, like national parks and tourism boards, hire us to map and publish their outdoor locations as software products.</li>
			<li>Disaster Response: <a href="/blog/2020/mapping-the-unmapped-using-360-degree-photos/">Charity partners help us collect imagery in disaster settings</a>, where it is extremely important to get accurate information from the field.</li>
		</ul>
