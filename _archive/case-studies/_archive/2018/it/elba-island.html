	<p><strong>Elba Smart Exploring was a project commissioned by Visit Elba to enable anyone with a smartphone to explore the island's outdoor trails.</strong></p>

	<p>The island, housing over 200 beaches and 350 km of trails, wanted to focus its marketing towards outdoor adventure based holidaymakers.</p>

	<p>By mixing Street View 360 imagery with dedicated online websites and content, the aim was to give tourists booking their visits the tools to plan their excursions by choosing and building personalised itineraries, from the comfort of their sofa.</p>

	<p><a href="https://elbasmartexploring.com/suggeriti-da-noi/" target="_blank">The Elba Smart Exploring website allows you to choose your hike and start your virtual expedition</a>.</p>
