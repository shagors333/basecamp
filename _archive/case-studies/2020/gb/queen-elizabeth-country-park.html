	<p><strong>Queen Elizabeth Country Park (QECP) blends nature and nurture as skilfully as any landscape gardener.</strong></p>

	<p>Opened by (who else?) the Queen back in 1971, QECP consists of two fully way-marked off-road mountain bike trails, including plenty of natural trails to explore in the area.</p>

	<h3>About the QECP Trail Collective</h3>

	<p>In a familiar story for so many of the best trails in the UK, it was the passion of local riders that saw the development of mountain biking within the park.</p>

	<p>The Queen Elizabeth Country Park Trail Collective are a dedicated group of volunteers who give up their time and effort to build and maintain the mountain biking trails in the park.</p>

	<p>The Collective has poured a substantial amount of time into building the trails, and their efforts really show.</p>
