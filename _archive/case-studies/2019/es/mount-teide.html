	<p><strong>Mount Teide is a volcano on Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Spain. Its summit is the highest point in Spain (3,718 m).</strong></p>

	<p>Teide is an active volcano: its most recent eruption occurred in 1909 from the El Chinyero vent on the northwestern Santiago rift.</p>

	<p>The volcano and its surroundings comprise Teide National Park, which has an area of 18,900 hectares and was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO on June 28, 2007.</p>

	<p>Teide Observatory, a major international astronomical observatory, is located on the slopes of the mountain.</p>

	<p>Teide is the most visited natural wonder of Spain, the most visited national park in Spain and Europe and, in 2015, the eighth most visited in the world, with some 3 million visitors yearly.</p>

	<p>Many visitors, however, overlook the history and geology of this breathtaking landscape. By helping them to understand it before visiting, will improve their connection with the mountain, and ensure they explore sustainably, by not leaving litter and staying to the signposted trails.</p>
