	<p><strong>The River Wey is a 140 kilometre tributary of the River Thames in south east England.</strong></p>

	<p>The River Wey Navigation (opened in 1653 making it one of the oldest waterways in Britain) and Godalming Navigation (1764) form a continuous waterway which provides a 32 kilometre navigable route from the River Thames between Weybridge via Guildford to Godalming.</p>

	<p>This tranquil waterway running through the heart of Surrey, England, is divided into different sections, known as lengths, each with its own lock-keeper, who came to be known as lengthsmen.</p>

	<p>Paddling provides an excellent opportunity to explore the variety of environments the waterway passes through (and keep fit at the same time!).</p>
