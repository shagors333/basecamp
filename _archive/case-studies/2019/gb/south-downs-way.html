    <h3>About National Trails</h3>

    <p>Each Trail in England and Wales has a Trail Partnership made up of the local authorities responsible for the path on the ground.</p>

    <p>Each trail has a dedicated National Trail Officer or Manager with responsibility for keeping the Trail up to the high standards set for National Trails. Maintenance work is carried out by the local highway authorities together with landowners often with the help of volunteers.</p>
