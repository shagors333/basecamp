	<p><strong>The world's best job?</strong></p>

	<p>We think so.</p>

	<p>Here at Trek View we use 360-degree imagery to help protect people and the planet. Think Google Street View for the natural world.</p>

	<p>We're currently looking for a travel photographer on an initial 6 month contract to help us capture 360-degree tours for commercial clients around the world.</p>

	<p>Rainforests, mountaintops and beaches await.</p>

	<p>You provide the passport and energy. We'll provide the equipment, accommodation, and all travel expenses, on top of a salary of $350 USD per week.</p>

	<p>No previous photography experience is required. Budding smartphone photographers are welcome to apply.</p>

	<p>Though this job is not for everyone.</p>

	<p>We need someone who is:</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Prepared to be on the road (and in the air) for the 6 month period, starting in May/June 2020.</li>
			<li>Relatively fit. You will be covering up to 15 kilometres of uneven terrain on day by foot.</li>
			<li>In possession of a valid passport and is able to travel to Africa, Europe, and North and South America (we will fund required visa applications).</li>
			<li>Fluent in English. Ability to speak Spanish is a plus.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>If you're planning a gap year and have a sense of adventure, this job is perfect.</p>
