	<p>On the evening of Monday 23rd, March 2020, the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, announced country wide restrictions to slow down the spread of COVID-19.</p>

	<p>Even before the lockdown was announced, many were already self isolating at home.</p>

	<p>Social isolation, especially for those living alone, can be incredibly tough mentally.</p>

	<p>Today, Trek View announced it will be offering free virtual guided tours of North East Hampshire for the local community (and beyond), bringing them together and giving them the opportunity to learn more about their area from expert tour guides.</p>

	<p>Using video-conferencing software and Trek View's 360-degree image library, anyone with a PC or mobile device will be able to join a virtual tour to explore the green-spaces of the region as they are explained by an expert local tour guide.</p>

	<p>Tour guides will include members of the Fleet Pond Society who will virtually guide guests down the paths surrounding the pond and describe the wildlife found at this site of special scientific interest, and volunteers at the Basingstoke Canal Society who will take guests on a virtual journey down the canal explaining its history.</p>

	<p>David Greenwood, founder of Trek View, and local resident commented:</p>

	<p><em>"We've been running Treehouse, free virtual field trips, for students during the recent closure of schools due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Students, and parents, love them!"</em></p>

	<p><em>"To reduce the negative effects of social isolation we've decided to extend the same concept to include virtual guided tours for adults too."</em></p>

	<p>The company is starting with North East Hampshire because their team of volunteers have already captured a significant amount of imagery across the area.</p>

	<p>Local experts have also been incredibly forthcoming in giving up their time to guide the tours and share their knowledge with those embarking on the virtual explorations.</p>

	<p>In future, Trek View hopes to expand their virtual tour guiding concept to locations around the world, giving everyone with a PC or mobile device the opportunity to learn about the world interactively.</p>
