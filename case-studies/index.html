	<h3>Our work</h3>

	<p><a href="https://travalyst.org/" target="_blank">By 2030, 1.8 billion people will travel internationally</a>.</p>

	<p><a href="https://travalyst.org/" target="_blank">An estimated 8.8 trillion in the global economy was attributed to tourism in 2018</a>.</p>

	<p>The growing environmental problems associated with travel affect every single person on the planet.</p>

	<p>And travellers know this.</p>

	<p><a href="https://travalyst.org/" target="_blank">71% think travel companies should offer more sustainable travel sources.</a></p>

	<p><a href="https://kstatic.googleusercontent.com/files/82c56387b4c934a8bbfd63d92f52ef6ba5ec79e1b07512308baffb5101a61860bd4606b0746253cf580bc49a648060649c2c091acbea419b4fe74076a3b5738f" target="_blank">According to Google</a>, when searching for businesses, consumers use mapping products 44% of the time. Listings with photos and a virtual tour are twice as likely to generate interest.</p>

	<p>We want to make street-level imagery of the natural world a core part of the research and booking for the modern traveller.</p>

	<p>From allowing potential visitors to view the beauty of the landscape when planning trips (e.g. explore hiking trails) to learning about the local communities and businesses that can be found there (e.g. “where looks good for lunch?”).</p>

	<p>In the same way Google Street View revolutionised road level maps, we want to do the same for maps of the natural world, and more specifically, environmentally conscious local businesses.</p>

	<p>But it's important we do it sustainably.</p>

	<p>As documented in our <a href="/charters/environment">Environment Charter</a>, there are certain locations that we do not capture images of based on the risk of causing a negative impact to either the local environment or local communities.</p>
