	<p><strong>It is the longest river in England.</strong></p>

	<p>It has 45 locks.</p>

	<p>It is about 20 metres at its deepest.</p>

	<p>It is home to over 25 species of fish, boasts three areas of outstanding natural beauty and it’s the only river in Europe to have a national trail follow its entire length.</p>

	<p>Starting as a small trickle in the Cotswolds the River Thames travels over 346 kilometers through the heart of some of England’s most picturesque towns, right into the centre of London and eventually, out into the North Sea.</p>

	<p>The geographic features and historical importance of the Thames are taught in classrooms throughout the UK, and beyond. Now lessons can be supported with virtual tours allowing students to fully immerse themselves in what they are being taught, improving learning outcomes.</p>
