    <p><strong>The Basingstoke Canal runs for 51 kilometres, from Greywell Village in Hampshire to Woodham in Surrey.</strong></p>

    <p>Completed in 1794, it was built to connect Basingstoke with the River Thames at Weybridge via the Wey Navigation.</p>

    <p>Today the canal not only serves as a recreational waterway but is also a notable wildlife habitat -- the entire waterway, except for a length through Woking, was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1995.</p>

    <p>Apart from lack of funding, the Canalâ€™s other major problem is lack of water.</p>

    <p>Increased levels of water abstraction together with climate change have meant that use of the locks has had to be suspended for large parts of the summer.</p>

    <p>Showing local communities the issues the Canal faces will encourage them to help conserve it, get behind volunteer activities to maintain it, and make sure funding bodies realise the importance of supporting it properly so that it can be continued to be enjoyed by all.</p>
