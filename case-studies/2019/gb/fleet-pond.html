	<h3>About the Fleet Pond Society</h3>

	<p>The Fleet Pond Society is the voluntary group that exists to help protect and manage Fleet Pond Nature Reserve.</p>

	<p>The Fleet Pond restoration work is run in partnership between Hart District Council, Fleet Pond Society, MoD, Natural England and the Environment Agency.</p>

	<p>Volunteers and rangers work to maintain the diversity of wildlife habitat at the Reserve. This includes keeping the open heath and marsh areas free of invasive species; clearing footpaths of overhanging vegetation; repairing fences and strengthening the banks of streams against erosion.</p>

	<p>There are many ways supporters can help maintain the nature reserve and to fund the society's future conservation projects.</p>
