	<p><strong>The North East Hampshire constituency includes the towns and villages of Fleet, Greywell, Hartley Wintney, Hook, Odiham, and Yateley.</strong></p>

	<p>The towns within the North East Hampshire constituency regularly feature on various "<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42377578" target="_blank">Top 10 places to live in the UK</a>" lists, and it is truly a wonderful place to live.</p>

	<h3>Virtually explore North East Hampshire guided by local experts</h3>

	<p>Social isolation, especially for those living alone, can be incredibly tough mentally.</p>

	<p>During the ongoing lockdown put in place to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, Trek View is offering free virtual guided tours of North East Hampshire for the local community (and beyond), to bring people together and give them the opportunity to learn more about their area from expert tour guides.</p>

	<p>Tour guides will include members of the Fleet Pond Society who will virtually guide guests down the paths surrounding the pond and describe the wildlife found at this site of special scientific interest, and volunteers at the Basingstoke Canal Society who will take guests on a virtual journey down the canal explaining its history.</p>

	<p>All you will need is a computer, tablet, or smartphone connected to the internet.</p>

	<p>Dates and times are to be confirmed. Please enter your email below to register your interest in joining a virtually guided tour of North East Hampshire in the coming weeks.</p>
