	<p><strong>Queen Elizabeth Country Park (QECP) blends nature and nurture as skilfully as any landscape gardener.</strong></p>

	<p>Opened by (who else?) the Queen back in 1971, QECP consists of two fully way-marked off-road mountain bike trails, including plenty of natural trails to explore in the area.</p>
